## What now?

Well done sweetheart. You've made it as far as setting up a github account :) This is just the beginning, but it's a good solid footing from which to continue. The rest of my instructions will be held here. This is the follow on step from the original email I sent you.

There are a bunch of other things we need to get set up:

* Install software to your laptop and phone
* Set you up with an Azure account
* Set you up with access to various learning resources

## Software

There are some apps you need to install on both your laptop and your phone. You can install these on your current Dell XPS laptop until the new one arrives.

### Laptop Software

* Visual Studio Code or VSCode: Google "vscode" and the first hit should be a link to code.visualstudio.com. There should be a download link, click on it and look for a download for Windows 10. There are various options, but click on the default big button that says "Windows 7, 8, 10". This will download the file "VSCodeUserSetup...exe" Run the downloaded file and just follow the instructions. Stick with the default options if you are unsure.
