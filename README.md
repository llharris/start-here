Start here Beth

## What now?

Well done Beth. You've made it as far as setting up a github account :) This is just the beginning, but it's a good solid footing from which to continue. The rest of my instructions will be held here. This is the follow on step from the original email I sent you.

There are a bunch of other things we need to get set up:

* Install software to your laptop and phone
* Set you up with an Azure account
* Set you up with access to various learning resources

## General IT Learning Tips

Different approaches work for different people, but personally I find that trying to solve problems myself aids my learning and understanding. I was going to right detailed instructions which took you, step-by-step through the next things you need to do, but seeing how quickly you got through the first round of stuff, I think I can make it a bit harder for you :D

What I will do from now on is set you an objective with some pointers but I won't describe everything you need to do in sequence. You'll need to work that out yourself.

## Github Collaborator Invite

You should get an email to your b.c.sweet@outlook.com account saying `llharris invited you to llharris/start-here`. Click View Invitation which will take you to github.com, then accept the invitation. It'll take you back to this same page, but now you will have permission to collaborate on the content here with me. We'll cover that a bit later.

## Recap

So far you should have done the following:

- [ ] Created a new professional email address
- [ ] Set up a bitwarden password vault using your new email
- [ ] Installed or checked that it's already installed, Microsoft Visual Studio Code on your laptop

## Next Steps

There are a lot more things you need to do to get prepared, but the next task is going to happen here, kind of. 

We are going to get you to edit the code of this web page to create your own task list for track the next few things you need to do!
